# 🏡 EliteHomes - Your Dream Home Awaits

EliteHomes is a modern, functional, and fully **responsive** landing page template specifically designed for real estate companies and property search platforms. This template aims to provide a seamless and engaging user experience for showcasing properties, key features, and contact options.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** The template displays perfectly across all devices (desktops, tablets, phones) utilizing the Bootstrap framework and custom CSS media queries (`media.css`).
* **Fixed Mega-Navigation:** A sticky navbar at the top with a sophisticated **Mega Menu** dropdown for expansive and organized link display.
* **Bootstrap Carousel:** An attractive 'Hero' section with a sliding carousel for images/content to immediately capture visitor attention. Carousel controls are managed via custom JavaScript (`main.js`).
* **Structured Content Sections:** Dedicated sections for clearly presenting:
    * Featured Properties.
    * Property Types.
    * Popular Locations.
    * Useful Resources.
* **Contact Form:** A ready-to-use section for effective communication with potential clients.
* **Custom Styling:** Extensive use of CSS variables (`style.css`) for easy color and dimension customization.
* **Font Awesome Icons:** Integration of professional icons for enhanced visual appeal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using core web technologies:

* **HTML5** (for structure)
* **CSS3** (for styling, including CSS variables in `style.css` and media queries in `media.css`)
* **JavaScript** (for interactivity, specifically running the Bootstrap Carousel and managing the navbar toggle icons)
* **Bootstrap 5:** The layout and responsiveness rely heavily on the Bootstrap framework (using `bootstrap.min.css` and `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`).
